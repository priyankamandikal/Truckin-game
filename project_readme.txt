Strategy:
We are using a strategy that greedily chooses the best item based on the ratio of how much profit we obtain on buying and selling Q of the item to how much fuel is required to get it.

Q is the minimum of how much the buyer wants, how much the seller can sell and how much we can buy based on how much cash, weight and volume we have.

We also take detours to buy fuel whenever the fuel required is nearing the limit required to get back home. We consider the number of moves and fuel required to buy fuel and get home when we check if we can take a detour.
